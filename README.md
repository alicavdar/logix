# Logix: A simple rule-based condition language

Logix is a lightweight language for defining and checking conditions using custom fields and values. It supports different comparison operators, string matching, array checks, and logical groupings, so you can build complex rule sets easily.

Logix is indentation sensitive, similar to Python, meaning indentation is used to group conditions.

## Supported Operators

- Basic comparisons: `eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `lt`, `gte`, and `lte`.
- String operations: `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`.
- Range checks: Use `between` to see if a value is in a certain range.
- Logical operators: Combine conditions using `and` and `or`.
- Array checks: Use `in` to check if a value exists in a list.
- Negation: Use `not` to negate `in`, `contains`, `between`, `startsWith`, and `endsWith` operators.
- Deeply nested fields: Logix supports fields like `products[0].info.title` for more complex data structures.
- Indentation sensitivity: Just like Python, Logix uses indentation to group conditions.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a context example:

```go
context := map[string]interface{}{
    "price":    120,
    "status":   "active",
    "category": "electronics",
    "stock":    75,
}
```

And here's how you might define a rule:

```go
# This is a comment
group and
    price gt 100
    status eq "active" # This is a comment
    group or
        # This is a comment
        category in ["electronics", "furniture"]
        stock between 50 and 100
```

This rule checks:

- If price is greater than 100
- If status is "active"
- In the or group, it checks:
    - If category is either "electronics" or "furniture"
    - If stock is between 50 and 100

## Usage

You can evaluate this rule with the following code:

```go
result, err := logix.EvaluateLogix(input, context)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Evaluation Result:", result)
}
```

You can also load the context from a JSON file like this:
```go
context, err := logix.LoadContextFromFile("context.json")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error loading context:", err)
    return
}

result, err := logix.EvaluateLogix(input, context)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error evaluating rule:", err)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Evaluation Result:", result)
}
```

## TODOs

- Improve error messages to show line and column numbers for better debugging
- Remove panics from the parser and return proper errors instead
